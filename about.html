                                  <h2>What is the Robin Hood Army</h2>  
                                  <p>The Robin Hood Army is a zero-funds volunteer organization that works to get 
                                    surplus food from restaurants and communities to serve the less fortunate.

                                    Our ‚ÄúRobins‚Äù are largely students and young working professionals ‚Äì everyone 
                                    does this in their free time. The lesser fortunate sections of society we serve
                                     include homeless families, orphanages, patients from public hospitals and old
                                      age homes.</p>
                                      <h2>How did this Start</h2>
                                      <p>Modeled on the Re-Food program in Portugal, the Robin Hood Army started on 
                                        the streets of Delhi, India in August 2014.</p>
                                      <h2>So where are you now?</h2>
                                      <p>At last count, we have served 69.5 million people across 227 cities 
                                        in 12 countries. Still 1% Done.</p>
                                        <h2>What about Funds</h2>
                                        <p>We have just one rule ‚Äì we are a zero funds organization.
                                           The Robin Hood Army has no revenue, employees, nor office space ‚Äì if 
                                           you want to help, all we need is your time. </p>
                                        <h2>Wait. I don't grt it. How do you grow without money?</h2>
                                        <p>Simple ‚Äì we are in the business of spreading smiles. We share our 
                                          experiences on social media. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp are our
